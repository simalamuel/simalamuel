### 💻 About Me

Cybersecurity professional and researcher, with multiple published CVEs (CVE-2024-42898, CVE-2025-25535, CVE-2025-29322). My main expertise lies in Offensive Security (Pentesting and AppSec) and Vulnerability Management.

I have hands-on experience in security consulting, covering the full risk lifecycle — from the technical identification of vulnerabilities to the design of mitigation strategies. I collaborate closely with Infrastructure, Cloud, and Development teams to implement technical controls and integrate security solutions into their environments.

My work is guided by leading industry frameworks such as OWASP Top 10, MITRE ATT&CK, NIST, and ISO 27001.
